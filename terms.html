                                <br>8.1 The Company reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time in its sole discretion, without notice or liability to you. You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, as modified.
                                Please review the most current version of the Terms and Conditions from time to time, so you will be apprised of any changes. Your continued use of the Online Services or Materials after any such change shall constitute
                                your express consent to be bound by such changes.
                                <br>8.2 Charges and Payment Terms may be changed in accordance with the applicable price schedule; all other provisions may be changed by the Company immediately. Your access to the Online Services may be terminated immediately
                                upon notice to the provider of the Online Services if any change is unacceptable. Continued use of the Online Services following any change constitutes acceptance of the change.
                                <br>8.3 The Company may terminate your access to the Online Services. The effective date of termination shall be ten (10) days after the receipt of an appropriate notice of termination, unless a later date is specified
                                in the notice. The Company may suspend or discontinue providing the Online Services to you without notice and pursue any other remedy legally available to it if you fail to comply with any of your obligations hereunder.
                                <br>8.4 Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing or displayed electronically in the Online Services by the Company. Notices shall be deemed to have been properly
                                given on the date deposited in the U.S. mail, if mailed; on the date first made available, if displayed in the Online Services; or on the date received, if delivered in any other manner. Notices to the Company should be
                                sent to: <a href="#">support@totalsurvey.com</a>
                                <br>8.5 The failure of the Company or any third party supplier of Materials to enforce any provision hereof shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce it at a later time.
                                <br>8.6 If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this
                                Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been contained herein.
                                <br>8.7 You may not assign your rights or delegate your duties under your access to the Online Services without the prior written consent of the Company.
                                <br>8.8 These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania and Montgomery County.
